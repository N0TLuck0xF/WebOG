  ### **WebOG Minecraft Integration Plan**  
1. **WebOG GUI Mod for Minecraft**  
   - Adds a WebOG overlay inside Minecraft.  
   - Allows players to access WebOG Messenger, Marketplace, and Leaderboards.  
   - Real-time WebOG notifications in-game.  

2. **WebOG Minecraft Servers**  
   - Players get a **free land plot** to build on.  
   - XP can be earned by **building structures** and contributing to the community.  
   - WebOG-exclusive events, quests, and competitions.  

3. **WebOG Marketplace for Minecraft**  
   - Players can **buy/sell their land plots** in the WebOG Marketplace.  
   - Land ownership can be transferred via an **escrow-based system**.  
   - Custom mods, skins, and texture packs can also be sold.  

I'll now update `webOGMinecraft.md` with this plan.

The `webOGMinecraft.md` file has been updated with the full integration plan. Let me know if you want to add anything else! ðŸš€
